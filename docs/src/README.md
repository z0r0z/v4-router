# V4 Swap Router

A simple and optimized router for swapping on Uniswap V4. ABI inspired by [`UniswapV2Router02`](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Router02.sol).

## Design

The Uniswap V4 Swap Router supports the following features:

- Exact input swaps
- Exact output swaps
- Multi-hop swaps
- Native token (ETH) swaps
- Hook interactions
- Custom swap curves

## Deployment

Every chain at [0x00000000000044AcF0C243EECB34c8C0069B2E4B](https://contractscan.xyz/contract/0x00000000000044AcF0C243EECB34c8C0069B2E4B)

# Usage

## Install

*requires [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh)*

```bash
forge install z0r0z/v4-router
```

## Exact Input

- For swaps, where users are specifying the input amount and want the maximum output possible

*Trade 1000 USDC into x Ether*

### Single Pool Swaps - Exact Input

For simple swaps on a singular pool

```solidity
IUniswapV4Router04 router = IUniswapV4Router04(...);

uint256 amountIn = 1e18;                 // amount of input tokens
uint256 amountOutMin = 0.99e18;          // minimum amount of output tokens, otherwise revert
bool zeroForOne = true;                  // swap token0 for token1
PoolKey memory poolKey = PoolKey(...);   // the pool to swap on
bytes memory hookData;                   // optional arbitrary data to be provided to the hook
uint256 deadline = block.timestamp + 60; // deadline for the transaction to be mined
router.swapExactTokensForTokens(
    amountIn,
    amountOutMin,
    zeroForOne,
    poolKey,
    hookData,
    receiver,
    deadline
);
```

### Multihop Swaps - Exact Input

For swaps trading through multiple pools

```solidity
IUniswapV4Router04 router = IUniswapV4Router04(...);

// Example swapPath: A --> B --> C
Currency startCurrency = currencyA;
PathKey[] memory path = new PathKey[](2);
path[0] = PathKey({
    intermediateCurrency: currencyB,
    fee: fee0,                           // fee tier of the (A, B) pool
    tickSpacing: tickSpacing0,           // tick spacing of the (A, B) pool
    hooks: IHooks(address(...)),         // hook address of the (A, B) pool
    hookData: hookData0                  // optional arbitrary bytes to passed to the (A, B) pool's beforeSwap/afterSwap functions
});
path[1] = PathKey({
    intermediateCurrency: currencyC,
    fee: fee1,                           // fee tier of the (B, C) pool
    tickSpacing: tickSpacing1,           // tick spacing of the (B, C) pool
    hooks: IHooks(address(...)),         // hook address of the (B, C) pool
    hookData: hookData1                  // optional arbitrary bytes to passed to the (B, C) pool's beforeSwap/afterSwap functions
});

uint256 amountIn = 1e18;                 // amount of input tokens
uint256 amountOutMin = 0.99e18;          // minimum amount of output tokens, otherwise revert
uint256 deadline = block.timestamp + 60; // deadline for the transaction to be mined
router.swapExactTokensForTokens(
    amountIn, amountOutMin, startCurrency, path, receiver, deadline
);
```

## Exact Output

- For swaps, where users are specifying the output amount and want the minimum input possible

*Trade x USDC into 1.0 Ether*

### Single Pool Swaps - Exact Output

For simple swaps on a singular pool

```solidity
IUniswapV4Router04 router = IUniswapV4Router04(...);

uint256 amountOut = 1e18;                // amount of output tokens expected
uint256 amountInMax = 1.01e18;           // maximum amount of input tokens, otherwise revert
bool zeroForOne = true;                  // swap token0 for token1
PoolKey memory poolKey = PoolKey(...);   // the pool to swap on
bytes memory hookData;                   // optional arbitrary data to be provided to the hook
uint256 deadline = block.timestamp + 60; // deadline for the transaction to be mined
router.swapTokensForExactTokens(
    amountOut,
    amountInMax,
    zeroForOne,
    poolKey,
    ZERO_BYTES,
    receiver,

```

## Architecture

The router is implemented in two main contracts:

1. `BaseSwapRouter`: Contains core swap logic and handles callbacks from the Pool Manager
2. `UniswapV4Router04`: Inherits from BaseSwapRouter and implements the user-facing interface

## Optimizations

The implementation prioritizes gas efficiency through:

- Minimal state changes
- Optimized memory usage in multi-hop swaps
- Single-swap vs multi-swap specific codepaths
- Efficient native token handling
- Reuse of Pool Manager callbacks

## Interface

The router provides three categories of swap functions:

### Multi-pool Swaps
- `swapExactTokensForTokens`: Swap exact input amount through multiple pools
- `swapTokensForExactTokens`: Receive exact output amount through multiple pools
- `swap`: Generic multi-pool swap interface

### Single-pool Swaps
- `swapExactTokensForTokens`: Swap exact input in a single pool
- `swapTokensForExactTokens`: Receive exact output from a single pool
- `swap`: Generic single-pool swap interface

### Optimized Swaps
- `swap(bytes, uint256)`: Pre-encoded swap data for reduced gas costs

## Path Construction

Multi-hop swaps are defined using the `PathKey` struct:

```solidity
struct PathKey {
    Currency intermediateCurrency;
    uint24 fee;
    int24 tickSpacing;
    IHooks hooks;
    bytes hookData;
}
```

## Getting Started

Run: `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash && source ~/.bashrc && foundryup`

Build the foundry project with `forge build`. Run tests with `forge test`. Measure gas with `forge snapshot`. Format with `forge fmt`.
